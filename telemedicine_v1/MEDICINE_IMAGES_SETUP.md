# Medicine Images Setup

To complete the multiple medicine images feature, you need to add the following image files to your `assets/images/` directory:

## Required Images:

- `medicine.jpg` ✅ (already exists)
- `medicine1.jpg` (create this)
- `medicine2.jpg` (create this)
- `medicine3.jpg` (create this)
- `medicine4.jpg` (create this)

## Image Specifications:

- **Size:** 150x150 pixels (or any square aspect ratio)
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Content:** Medicine-related images (pills, capsules, medicine bottles, etc.)
- **Style:** Professional, clean, medical theme

## How It Works:

1. **Consistent Images:** Each medicine name will always get the same image (based on name hash)
2. **Multiple Varieties:** 5 different images will be distributed across different medicines
3. **Fallback System:** If an image fails to load, a colored placeholder will be shown
4. **Color Coding:** Placeholders use different colors (blue, green, orange, purple, red) based on medicine name

## Current Status:

- ✅ Code implementation complete
- ✅ Asset paths configured in pubspec.yaml
- ⏳ Need to add actual image files (medicine1.jpg through medicine4.jpg)

## Alternative:

If you don't want to add actual image files, the system will automatically show beautiful colored placeholders with medicine icons for each product.
