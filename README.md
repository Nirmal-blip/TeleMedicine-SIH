# AI-Powered Telemedicine Platform

## Overview
Access to quality healthcare remains a challenge, especially in underserved and rural areas with limited medical infrastructure. This AI-powered telemedicine platform bridges this gap by enabling remote healthcare consultations, making medical expertise accessible without requiring physical visits. 

This platform integrates AI and ML technologies to facilitate intelligent diagnosis, automate appointment scheduling, and recommend alternative treatments. The system ensures real-time doctor-patient communication through video consultations and an AI-powered chatbot for preliminary diagnoses.

## Key Features

- **NLP-Based Interface** – Enables users to interact in their local language for better understanding.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot for Diagnosis** – Assesses symptoms and suggests preliminary recommendations if a doctor is unavailable.
- **Automated Appointment Scheduling** – Users can schedule consultations or receive AI-generated Do’s & Don’ts based on symptom analysis.
- **Interactive Map for Nearby Healthcare Services** – Displays available doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies.
- **1:1 Video Calling with Doctors** – Secure WebRTC-based video consultations.
- **Medicine Recognition Model** – Identifies medicines from images or names and suggests cheaper or more available alternatives.

## AI/ML Integration
The platform utilizes AI for:
- **Symptom Checking & Preliminary Diagnosis** – AI-driven symptom analysis provides probable conditions, risk analysis, and treatment suggestions.
- **Medicine Recognition & Alternative Recommendations** – Deep learning models process medical images and text.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Chatbot Optimization** – Chatbot interactions continuously improve based on user feedback.
- **Future Enhancements** – Integration with wearables for real-time health monitoring and AI-powered disease recognition from images.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** – Provides a smooth and responsive UI.

### Backend
- **Node.js (Express.js)** – Manages API requests and backend logic.
- **SupaBase & MongoDB** – Stores user data and medical records securely.
- **Socket.io & WebRTC** – Enables real-time video consultations.

### AI/ML Components
- **TensorFlow & Scikit-Learn** – Implements AI-powered chatbot and medical image classification.
- **NLTK & Hugging Face** – Processes natural language for chatbot responses.
- **Google Maps API & OpenStreetMap** – Provides navigation and nearby healthcare services.

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction:** Patients describe symptoms via NLP-based chatbot or opt for a 1:1 video consultation.
2. **AI Diagnosis:** The chatbot processes symptoms and provides health recommendations.
3. **Medicine Recognition:** Users upload medicine images or names for alternative recommendations.
4. **Appointment Scheduling:** The system enables users to book consultations after symptom analysis.
5. **Data Processing:** All interactions are securely managed via the Node.js backend and stored in databases.
6. **Real-Time Consultation:** WebRTC-based secure video calls connect users with specialists.
7. **Continuous Improvement:** Reinforcement learning optimizes chatbot responses over time.

## Deployment & Security
- **Cloud Deployment** – Ensures scalability and reliability.
- **Compliance with HIPAA & GDPR** – Protects user data and ensures privacy.
